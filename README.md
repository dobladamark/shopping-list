# 🛒 Grocery Shopping List 

This simple project demonstrates how to manage a shopping list using arrays and built-in methods like `push`, `pop`, `shift`, and `unshift`.  
It logs messages to the console as items are added, removed, or modified in the list.  

---

## 📌 Features
- Add items to the end of the shopping list (`push`)
- Add items to the beginning (`unshift`)
- Remove items from the end (`pop`)
- Remove items from the beginning (`shift`)
- Update items by directly accessing array indexes
- Display the current list with a helper function

---

## 📝 Example Flow
1. Start with an empty shopping list.  
2. Add `"Apples"` and `"Grapes"`.  
3. Add `"Vegetable Oil"` to the start.  
4. Add multiple items at once: `"Popcorn"`, `"Beef Jerky"`, `"Potato Chips"`.  
5. Remove `"Potato Chips"` (junk food).  
6. Add `"Chocolate Cake"`, then remove it in favor of `"Canola Oil"` for health-conscious choices.
